    <h3>- a french delight</h3>

    <p>
      Did you know that croissants originated from a 13th-century Austrian
      pastry called kipferl? The iconic crescent shape symbolizes the moon,
      representing the victory over the Ottoman Empire during the Battle of
      Vienna in 1683. It wasn’t until the 19th century that croissants made
      their way to France, where bakers perfected the flaky texture we adore
      today. Authentic French croissants are crafted through a meticulous
      layering process of butter and dough, creating that irresistible
      flakiness. Enjoying a warm croissant with a café au lait is a beloved
      French breakfast tradition, making it the perfect start to your day!
