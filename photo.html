      Croissants are made using a technique called lamination, which layers
      dough and butter for that signature flaky texture. The traditional French
      recipe for croissants dates back to the 19th century, blending Austrian
      influences with French baking techniques. Enjoying a freshly baked
      croissant is a popular breakfast ritual in France, often paired with
      coffee for the ultimate morning treat!
